# Image_Generation_GANs
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a type of deep learning model used for generating realistic images and other data types. GANs consist of two neural networks—the Generator and the Discriminator—that compete against each other in a zero-sum game framework.

To improve my project, I plan to make several enhancements across the files and processes. Starting with bgtday2.ipynb, I want to modularize the notebook into clear sections like data preparation, model definition, training, and evaluation. I’ll also create reusable functions for tasks like data preprocessing, saving models, and visualizing outputs to keep the code organized. To optimize training, I’m considering advanced techniques like using AdamW or gradient clipping for better stability, along with learning rate schedulers to adjust learning rates dynamically. Integrating tools like TensorBoard or Weights & Biases will help me track metrics and visualize performance. I also plan to save model checkpoints at regular intervals so that I can resume training without losing progress. Adding automated evaluations like FID and Inception Score during training and visual comparisons of generated images will give me a better sense of how well the model is performing.

For fidfinal.ipynb, I’m working on automating the FID score calculation. I’ll allow dynamic input paths for generated images, real images, and model weights, which will make the process more flexible. I also want to optimize the FID computation by using batched image processing to handle large datasets more efficiently. Plotting FID scores across epochs will help me analyze how the model improves over time. To avoid errors during execution, I’ll implement checks for file paths and handle exceptions gracefully.

In app.py, I’m focusing on making the deployment more interactive and user-friendly. I want to add sliders for adjusting noise vector inputs and drop-down menus for selecting different models. I’ll also include functionality to display generated images directly on the interface with an option to download them. Supporting multiple generator.h5 files will allow me to test different versions of the model easily. To improve performance, I’ll optimize inference by utilizing hardware acceleration like GPUs or TPUs.
